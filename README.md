# Word hunt

Word hunt is a word puzzle game that is based on 'Ordjakten' which is published daily in the swedish Newspaper, Svenska Dagbladet. The objective with the printed game is to find as many words with at least four letters (where on e should be the the letter in the black square in the middle).
